# Welcome to Movie Finder (WIP)!

Movie Finder is a react-based, robust, no frills movie search engine that quickly lets users search for movies based on movie titles and returns basic movie information (such as director, country, awards, and its genre).

From there, Movie Finder, lets users add these movies to a favorites list.

This was made to demonstrate proficiency in full stack engineering, primarily demonstrating proficiency in React as well as the MERN stack.

Happy viewing!
