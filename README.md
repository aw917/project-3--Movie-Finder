# Welcome to sample Project 3!

This project was created to demonstrate proficiency in the MERN stack and working with live APIs.

The site is an incredibly simple movie search engine that is designed to let someone simply search for a movie by its title and then add it to a list for future viewing.

Live link on heroku is: https://project-3-moviefinder.herokuapp.com 

Happy viewing!
